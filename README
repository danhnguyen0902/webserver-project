We have the main checking the flags and argument values for the server settings.  The mode is then set to server on default or relay if the flag is given.
There is then a while loop that continues to accept connections and starts off a new thread to execute the server functions for each accepted client.  This
is done in IPV6 for the server connection so it can stay consistent for both IPV4 and IPV6 values if either were to be obtained.  The server functions 
themselves are located in a "doit" function that contains a while loop that breaks when the connection is broken or HTTP 1.0 is the given version.  
This is done to display persistence in connections for HTTP 1.1.  In this, the uri of the input is checked for specific functions that exectute if the 
command is seen and use "continue" to avoid multiple commands going through at once.  The systems information is obtained from reading from a file
descriptor that takes the values and outputs them.  The synthetic load requests are done through done through simple logic.  The serving of files uses
parser helper functions to check the file types to output and does so except in the case where they try to access files not in the "files" folder.  The 
widgets are executed in files/index.html where it uses the found local IP for the server IP.  There are seperate instances not included in which these
IP values are replaced by the respective Amazon EC2 instance public IP addresses.
